JA2 UB tilesets for JA2.
Snap <tacpans@yahoo.com>

This package contains files that are necessary to import maps using JA2 UB
tilesets #50-59 into JA2.

Installation: Unpack the archive into the JA2 main directory.  The files will be
unpacked into Data-1.13 subdirectory.  If you are using a different custom data
directory, you need to move all of the included files and subdirectories there:

Binarydata\ja2set.dat
Tilesets\50
...
Tilesets\59

Notes:

This add-on will only work in JA2 1.13, or any version of JA2 that has been
modified to accept tilesets with numbers 50 or higher.  Alternatively, the UB
tilesets can be used to replace existing JA2 tilesets (for that, ja2set.dat
needs to be modified accordingly).

Maps created with the UB editor or original UB campaign maps need to be
converted to JA2 format first.

In tilesets 53-59 snow-covered graphics, such as sandbags, were replaced with
more appropriate JA2 graphics.
