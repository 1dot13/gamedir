New Starting Gear Interface Beta 0.4
Build from MP Beta Branch Rev. 3582
Credits for helping: Warmsteel, Headrock and smeagol

Description:
Purpose of this modification is to make all starting gear items visible in the AIM website, at the
same time functionality to select up to 5 starting gear kits has been added.

This modification will change the way that the AIM website will look, adjustments have been made to
the size and position of certain items to create space for the extra items that are displayed.

For testing purposes the MercStartingGear.xml file has some changes, GEARKIT's from Mercs have been
randomly copied/pasted to act as extra GEARKIT's for other Mercs, the clean file is included in a 7z
file in the root of the folder.
The new MercStartingGear.xml file is not compatible with the XML Editor nor is it compatible with the
vanilla executable!

Included in this release is a new hotkey for in the strategic view, SHIFT+W will make your selected merc drop ALL ITEMS
instead of just carried items in the case of SHIFT+E

There's also a modification to the way the Merc on assignment system works.
In Ja2_Options.INI there's a way to set if a Merc can be on assignment at the start of the game, this
has been upgraded so that there's an option
that makes Mercs not go on any other assignments than yours during the whole duration of the campaign.
As default it's set to standard behaviour, so if you don't like it don't edit it.
The ini setting is placed under category [Recruitment Settings]

;Mercs can be on assignment?
; 0 = default behaviour, mercs are on assignment at start, mercs go on assignment during campaign
; 1 = all mercs available at the start of the game, during the campaign they will go on assignment
; 2 = all mercs at your disposal. nobody goes on any other assignment than yours
MERCS_CAN_BE_ON_ASSIGNMENT = 0


new in 0.4 is the possibility to enable/disable NSGI in Ja2_Options.ini under the category [Graphics Settings]
NSGI is ofcourse enabled in the ini in this package

;New Starting Gear Interface
;This will enable the 21 item view in the AIM page and the possibility to select gearkits
;If set to FALSE, the game will use the original AIM page and 21 item view and gearkit selection are disabled (1st kit is used)
;If set to TRUE, the game will use the new starting gear interface, this will enable 21 item view and gearkit selection
USE_NEW_STARTING_GEAR_INTERFACE = TRUE


There are no settings for NSGI, it expects an altered MercStartingGear.xml
where the gear is put into GEARKIT's.
If only one GEARKIT is defined for a merc no selection buttons will be shown.
Up to 5 GEARKIT's can be defined per merc, the amount of GEARKIT's can vary per merc.
More than one GEARKIT will only work for AIM Merc's!!
Here under a demo of how the new XML looks, this is just for one Merc...

single gearkit, only the mIndex and mName tag stay outside the GEARKIT, everything else goes into the GEARKIT
<MERCGEARLIST>
	<MERCGEAR>
		<mIndex>0</mIndex>
		<mName>Barry</mName>
    <GEARKIT>
      items...
    </GEARKIT>
  </MERCGEAR>
</GEARLIST>

or multiple gearkits
<MERCGEARLIST>
	<MERCGEAR>
		<mIndex>0</mIndex>
		<mName>Barry</mName>
    <GEARKIT>
      items...
    </GEARKIT>
    <GEARKIT>
      items...
    </GEARKIT>
    <GEARKIT>
      items...
    </GEARKIT>
    <GEARKIT>
      items...
    </GEARKIT>
    <GEARKIT>
      items...
    </GEARKIT>
  </MERCGEAR>
</GEARLIST>

compared to the original way
<MERCGEARLIST>
	<MERCGEAR>
		<mIndex>0</mIndex>
		<mName>Barry</mName>
    items...
  </MERCGEAR>
</GEARLIST>
