FAQs
----

Q: I started the server, but others can't connect.
A: Check the following things:
	a.) The JA2 MP Executable file should not be blocked by your firewall
	b.) The other players have my external IP and use them for joining. 
	    You can get your external IP from here: http://www.whatismyip.com
	c.) The Port (default: 60005) is forwarded on your router

Q: How do I forward my port on the router?
A: Take a look at the following website: http://portforward.com/

Q: How can I find out my external IP?
A: http://www.whatismyip.com

Q: How can I find out my internal IP?
A: Click "START" -> "RUN" -> cmd
   Type "ipconfig /all" (Search for IP Address)

Q: Please give me a step by step example how you forwarded the port on your router.
A: I have a (wireless) Belkin router. The steps I did are the following:
	a.) First I check my internal ip address (-> 192.168.2.2)
	b.) I open the routers configuration page in the web browser. This is often your IP ending with a "1".
            In my case this is "192.168.2.1". So I entered "http://192.168.2.1" in the browser and the configuration site opens
	c.) I click on "Firewall" -> "Virtual Servers" and "Submit" the login page with a blank password. 
	d.) Now I see a table on the website where I can enter the IP addresses and ports for forwarding
	e.) I enter the internal IP address (192.168.2.2) and the port (60005) and select the port forwaring for "UDP" and "TCP"
	f.) Save the changes on the configuration site
	g.) Start the JA2 1.13 MP Executable and host a game
