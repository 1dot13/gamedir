Design Document MOLLE

###Principles###

For each LBE item, there's a definition which pockets may be changed and how much space the new pockets may take up in total.
For each Pocket, there's a definition how much space it takes up on a carrier.

If there's a free pocket slot and enough space -> attach item and enable pocket.

E.G.:
A Carrier leg rig may have an available Volume of 25 and 5 available pockets (=5 attachmentslots)
An AR-Mag pocket has a volume of 8
A Small Utility pocket has a volume of 5

You may add 3 AR-Mag pockets to the Carrier
OR
5 SU pockets
OR
1 AR and 3 SU
OR
2 AR and 2 SU
BUT
not 4 AR, as their total volume would be 32

###Tags###

===Pockets.xml===
<pVolume></pVolume>
	How large is this pocket? This is used internally to check if a carrier can't fit anymore pockets, even if there are empty slots.
	
===LoadBearingEquipment.xml===
<lbeAvailableVolume></lbeAvailableVolume>
	How much space is there to add pockets?

<lbePocketsAvailable></lbePocketsAvailable>
	A bitfield that determines if a free spot can be used at all (limits the number of slots on smaller carriers)

===AttachmentSlots.xml===
<ubPocketMapping></ubPocketMapping>
	The pocket that this slot changes
	Range 1-12
	Corresponds to PocketIndex1...12
	
===Items.xml===
<AttachmentClass>16777216</AttachmentClass>
	Not a new tag, but this AC denotes pouch attachments and accepts duplicates like Grenade and Rocket do
