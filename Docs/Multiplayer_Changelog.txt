Turn bar was not updated on the clients, if Enemy got back its turn after interrupt
The file "transfer_rules.txt" did not allow "Umlaute"
CTD in Tactical when "Enforce Maximum AI" was selected in CO-OP after first enemy was killed
Possible CTD when client disconnects from game
When server is running in 640x480 and select NIV in host screen, it did not check if NIV is allowed and it was initialized with NIV even NIV is not allowed in 640x480
If you quit a MP game and start another one at night time it was still daytime in tactical placement GUI
Valid starting times (eg: 12:00, 00:30) was outputted as invalid times in the HOST screen
