This file defines patrols in game.

Fields index:
	Size			- base number of soldiers in patrol. Actual number of soldiers is
				  calculated as base number plus/minus 1 and then max/min limits
				  are applied. Max limit is MAX_STRATEGIC_TEAM_SIZE in INI, and
				  min limit is *_MIN_ENEMY_GROUP_SIZE. Provide integer number.

	Priority		- Hmmm... Priority is priority. It defines importance of patrol
				  group to Queen. More important - more chances to get reinforcements,
				  more chances to upgrade admins to regular troops. Provide 
				  value from interval [0..100].

	Waypoints		- this categiory define route of patrolling group. You are given
				  up to 4 (2 is a minimum) sector check-points. At a check-point
				  patrol can change direction of movement. Only horizontal and
				  vertical movement is allowed, diagonal is restricted. In case
				  short routes (e.g. 2 or 3 points) fill unused sectors with 0.
				  And also you cannot use sector A1 in routes. Patrol moves through
				  route like a ball in ping-pong, e.g. ...-1-2-3-4-3-2-1-2-3...
				  Starting point is random.
				  
	Sector1..4  		- it is where patrol will be coursing. Provide valid sector name
				  or 0, if this field is unused.

NOTE: Maximum 50 patrols can be used in game.

Changes require starting of a new game.
