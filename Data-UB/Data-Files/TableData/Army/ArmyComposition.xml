Army composition soldier count calculation:

1)  game calculate number of admins (NumAdmins = AdminPercentage * StartPopulation / 100)
2)  for the rest soldiers game makes a loop:
2a) soldier check to be elite
2b) soldier check to be regular troop
2c) if both checks failed, none soldier is added
3)  step 2 is executed until there are unchecked soldiers left


NOTE: Maximum 60 army compositions can be used in game.

Changes require starting of a new game.
