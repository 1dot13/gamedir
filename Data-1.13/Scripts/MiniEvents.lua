For inner workings, see MiniEvents.h/cpp

It is *HIGHLY* recommend that you make backup of this file before modifying it.

Main entry points are at the bottom of this file: BeginRandomEvent() and BeginSpecificEvent()
You will probably only need to modify the Events and HiddenEvents tables.

Available calls:
CResolveEvent(text, nextEventId, hoursToNextEvent)
	- this is the exit handler for an event.
	- this MUST be called at the end of each event's Resolution function.
	- text appears in the message box after the player clicks on either button. It will be truncated to 450 characters.
	- nextEventId is optional. If specified, the next mini event will be triggered through BeginSpecificEvent() instead of BeginRandomEvent(), with this value as the eventId parameter.
	- hoursToNextEvent is optional. If specified, the next mini event will trigger in this many hours (must be an integer greater than zero). This timer IGNORES the minimum/maximum time between events defined by the user in JA2_Options.ini.
	- does not return anything
CScreenMsg(text)
	- text appears in the message log (bottom left in the strategic view)
	- does not return anything

CAddIntel(amount) returns {true/false}
	- amount can be positive (for credits) or negative (for debits)
	- if the player has Intel disabled, this instead adds or subtracts cash, at an exchange rate of 1 intel = $500
	- returns true on a successful transaction and false on an unsuccessful transaction
CAddMoneyToPlayerAccount(amount, negativeZeroesAccount) returns {true/false}
	- amount can be positive (for credits) or negative (for debits)
	- negativeZeroesAccount is optional. if true, a negative transaction will always succeed, setting the player's balance to zero if the debit exceeds it.
	  if negativeZeroesAccount is omitted, or false, the transaction will fail if the player's balance is less than the debit.
	- returns true on a successful transaction and false on an unsuccessful transaction
CAddSkill(profileId, skillId)
	- adds a skill to the specified merc if allowable. ie, you can't add auto weapons to a merc with two levels of it already.
	- profileId is a merc's ID, which was passed in through BeginRandomEvent or BeginSpecificEvent
	- skillId must be a value from the SKILLS enum below
	- does not return anything
CAddTownLoyalty(townId, amount)
	- townId must be a value from the TOWNS enum below
	- amount can be positive or negative
	- note that this is not percentage change. This applies a number of "points" to the town's loyalty, and the amount of points required for a 1% change may be
	  slightly different for each town (see Cities.xml, townRebelSentiment for each town's modifier).
	- does not return anything
CAdjustBreathMax(profileId, amount)
	- profileId is a merc's ID, which was passed in through BeginRandomEvent or BeginSpecificEvent
	- amount can be positive or negative
	- does not return anything
CAdjustEnemyStrengthInSector(x, y, admin, troop, elite, robot, jeep, tank)
	- adjusts the number of enemy types in the specified sector
	- x, y are sector coordinates (z will be 0)
	- admin/troop/elite/robot/jeep/tank are additions or subtractions to the sector
	- the number of each enemy is bound between 0 and 30 (ie, you can have 20 admins and 20 troops, but not 40 admins)
	- if the ASD is disabled, robots/jeeps/tanks will be set to 0
	- does not return anything
CAdjustMorale(profileId, amount)
	- profileId is a merc's ID, which was passed in through BeginRandomEvent or BeginSpecificEvent
	- amount can be any nonzero positive or negative value
	- does not return anything
CAdjustStat(profileId, stat, amount)
	- profileId is a merc's ID, which was passed in through BeginRandomEvent or BeginSpecificEvent
	- stat must be a value from the STATS enum below
	- amount can be positive or negative
	- negative amounts can be healed by doctoring. Note that only physical stats can be healed (LIFE, STRENGTH, DEXTERITY, AGILITY, WISDOM).
	- experience level cannot be modified.
	- does not return anything
CAdjustVehicleFuel(profileId, amount) returns {success, vehicleName}
	- adds or subtracts fuel from a vehicle
	- profileId is a merc's ID, and is used to determine which vehicle to affect (meaning that the merc has to be sitting in a vehicle)
	- amount can be positive (add fuel) or negative (lose fuel)
	- returns {success, vehicleName}, where success is true/false, and vehicleName is the name of the affected vehicle
CAdjustVehicleHealth(profileId, amount) returns {success, vehicleName}
	- repairs or damages a vehicle
	- profileId is a merc's ID, and is used to determine which vehicle to affect (meaning that the merc has to be sitting in a vehicle)
	- amount can be positive (repair/gain hp) or negative (damage/lose hp)
	- returns {success, vehicleName}, where success is true/false, and vehicleName is the name of the affected vehicle
CApplyPermanentStatDamage(profileId, stat, amount)
	- this reduces a merc's stats. Unlike CAdjustStat, stats reduced by this call CANNOT be healed through surgery (doctoring or visiting the hospital). 
	- profileId is a merc's ID, which was passed in through BeginRandomEvent or BeginSpecificEvent
	- stat must be a value from the STATS enum below
	- amount must be positive, or this will have no effect
	- does not return anything
CApplyDamage(profileId, amount)
	- this reduces a merc's current health
	- profileId is a merc's ID, which was passed in through BeginRandomEvent or BeginSpecificEvent
	- amount can be positive or negative. If positive, damages a merc. If negative, heals a merc.
	- this can kill a merc if their health is reduced to 0!
	- does not return anything
CCheckForAssignment(assignmentId, x, y, z) returns {true/false, nickname, id}
	- assignmentId must be a value from the ASSIGNMENTS enum below
	- x, y, z indicate the sector coordinates to check. These are optional. If excluded, searches through all mercs.

CCheckForTravelInHelicopter(profileId) returns {true/false}
	- returns true if the merc with the specified profileId is travelling between sectors in a helicopter
CCreateMilitia(greenMilitia, regularMilitia, eliteMilitia, x, y)
	- input parameters must be positive and indicate how much of each type of militia to create
	- militia will be created in the sector of the affected mercs
	- x, y indicate the sector coordinates to create the militia. Note that Z is excluded as militia cannot be placed underground.
	- does not return anything
CGetCoordinates(profileId) returns {x, y, z}
	- returns the x/y/z coordinates of the merc with the specified profileId
CGetHealth(profileId) returns {currentLife, maxLife}

	- note that LIFE refers to max health, not current health
	- x, y, z indicate the sector coordinates to check
	- profileId is optional. If specified, gets the stat of that merc. If not, gets the highest stat of any merc in the specified sector.

	- flag is either true or false
	- does not return anything
CSetMercCoordinates(profileId, x, y, z)
	- if called with CSendMercOnMiniEvent(), this should be called FIRST.
	- profileId is a merc's ID, which was passed in through BeginRandomEvent or BeginSpecificEvent
	- x, y, z are the coordinates to move to. Make sure the coordinates are valid! For z, 0 is ground level, 1 is 1 level below ground, etc.
	- does not return anything



Events should be formatted as follows:
	[<index>] = -- index must be a positive nonzero integer
	{
		INIT = function(mercList)
			-- in here, you can define how an event behaves. Note that mercList contains *all* of the player's mercs, formatted { nickname = profileId }
			-- this function MUST return a table with four elements: BodyText, TopButtonText, BottomButtonText, and Resolution
			-- Resolution is a function which contains one input parameter: a boolean indicating whether the player clicked the top button or not
			-- *IMPORTANT* Resolution MUST call CResolveEvent() at some point. This call wraps up the event and queues up the next one. If an integer value is passed as CResolveEvent's second parameter,
			   then the next mini event will be called through BeginSpecificEvent.
			-- example:

			return {
				BodyText = "This text appears in the main message box body.",
				TopButtonText = "This is the top button's text.",
				BottomButtonText = "This is the bottom button's text.",
				Resolution = function(result)
					if result then
						CResolveEvent("You clicked the top button")
					else
						CResolveEvent("You clicked the bottom button", 3)
					end
				end
			}
		end
	}

You can use tables to categorize and organize events as you see fit (eg for solo events, chained events, group events, daytime/nighttime events, etc).

Please ensure that index is unique for each event. Indices should also be sequential to make randomization easier.
TopButtonText and BottomButtonText will be truncated to 60 characters.
BodyText will be truncated to 450 characters.
The string in CResolveEvent will be truncated to 450 characters.
If you specify a second parameter in CResolveEvent, the next mini event will be triggered through BeginSpecificEvent with that value as its first parameter (eventId).
