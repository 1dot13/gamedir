<!--

This file handles sector variating through using or not using alternative maps.
Table represent game world. To disable randomness of sector, say E6, you have to
find its place in the table and put 0 (zero) there. Then JA2 will use only one map
for this sector: E6.DAT. If you put 1 (one) as a value in table, then the game will
choose from 2 map-files E6.DAT and E6_A.DAT to use it as map for sector E6. These 2
maps have equal chances to appear in game, 50/50.

NOTE1: this table is used only when you are starting a new game. Any changes to this
       file require starting a new game.

NOTE2: some sectors in game already using alternative map in original JA2
       It is Skyrider quest: B15, E14, D12, C16
             weapon caches: E11, H5, H10, J12, M9
             Madlab quest: H7, H16, I11, E4
             Gabby: I4
       Do not enable randomization of this sectors until you are know what you're doing
