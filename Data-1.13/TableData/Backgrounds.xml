        o(Information about ALTERNATIVE_IMP_CREATION and REDUCED_IMP_CREATION)

        If the options ALTERNATIVE_IMP_CREATION and REDUCED_IMP_CREATION are enabled in ja2_options.ini, choices made for skills, character traits and disablities 
		will have an impact on which IMP backgrounds are available at selection.
		That's based on tags in backgrounds which would contradict with content of skills, character traits and disablities
		Not all skills, character traits and disablities are part of this, some simply had no background tags that would interfere with their content (i.e. snitch)
		Also not all possible contradictions have been considered, mostly only one or two (with a few expceptions) where picked, typically some with larger impact
		
		Examples:
		Sociable grants a bonus to being spotter, so if background has a tag with negative value for spotter, this background won't be shown
		Loner is the opposite, it hands out a penalty to being spotter, so this time, if background has tag with positive value for spotter, it won't be shown
		Heat Intolerant hands out a penalty while in desert or tropical sectors, so if background has tag which would instead add a bonus, it won't be shown
		Squadleader grants a bonus to suppression ressistance to nearby others, so no background with negative value for surpression resistance will be shown 
		Bodybuilding adds a bonus to carrying weight capacity, so if there's a negative value in tag <carrystrength> in background, it won't be shown
				
		Details:
		
		If there is more than one tag mentioned, it's enough for one of them to be in background to result in a no show
		For major traits, relevant tags can differ between single and dual (expert), if so, the single is less restrictive than the dual (different tags or values)
		(i.e.: doctor dual   - if speedbandaging and/or medical is negative, don't show background -> two potentialy restricting tags
		       doctor single - if speedbandaging is negative, don't show background -> one potentialy restricting tag)
		The < and > signs are meant to show if it's about negative or positve value in tag, if there's just a 1, that's for tags that only have on/off properties

		Depending on choices made, this should result in a nice shuffle and can result in largely different outcomes
		With current default backgrounds, based on chosen combinations, the amount of no-show backgrounds can range from no impact up to a third or more		 
		To make up for this possible loss, additional backgrounds will be added when using ALTERNATIVE_IMP_CREATION and those are exclusive to these ini-options, 
		they won't be shown without them
		Same rules will apply to those exclusive backgrounds as well, but the pool of available backgrounds will be larger and since they are unique to this option, 
		they can also add to overall variety
		Using REDUCED_IMP_CREATION will be the opposite approach. It will result in only showing those aformentioned exclusive backgrounds, which at default 
		will result in a smaller pool. Again, the rules will still be applied, but they still should cover a range of essentials
		
		
        o(ALTERNATIVE_IMP_CREATION and REDUCED_IMP_CREATION)
	    
        if tag <alt_impcreation> = 1 
		 
		the background will be exclusivly used for ALTERNATIVE_IMP_CREATION and REDUCED_IMP_CREATION 
        background with this tag won't be shown without those options being TRUE in ja2_options.ini
	    it's only effective with IMP-backgrounds


        o(Developers Note)
		
		If editing backgrounds, I'd like to encourage you to not paying too much mind to those possible restrictions. It would of course be possible to nerf out any
		restrictions with choice of tags, but that would be kinda against the purpose. Just edit them the way you would for default IMP creation, don't let down the
		players which would prefer to use the default way of IMP creation by holding back on anything
		That said, maybe if editing the additional backgrounds, be a little considerate to avoid a complete no show with REDUCED_IMP_CREATION
		Anyway, up to anyone to do what they like, just my thoughts on the matter
