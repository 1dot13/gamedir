Changes in 1.12:
- fixed the history record added when you give Carmen one of the terrorist's heads
- Shank will no longer automatically be added to your party if you talk to him long enough
- fixed problems with MERCs not being hireable if you withheld money so long that they quit, then 
  you paid your balance
- fixed problem if at the last stage of IMP character creation (confirming payment) you hit 'cancel'
  (which resulted in no custom character being created, but at the same time preventing you from 
  creating another)
- prevented player from switching to the map screen if a list of items to pick up is being displayed
- fixed problem with the code to handle mercs surrendering to the enemy that would occur if you had 
  already played through the first surrender situation (Alma prison) and then had more mercs 
  surrender (which is supposed to trigger the interrogation scene with Deidranna, Eliot, and Joe)
- fixed history record for when characters die
- fixed the infamous "burst bug" which prevented some bullets from hitting a character if they
  were standing when hit

Changes in 1.11:
- fixed bug in which breath damage could cause values to wrap from very low to high values.  (Typically 
  seen with stun grenades – the player throws a stun grenade at an enemy who is knocked down, but gets 
  up the next turn raring to go.) 
- fixed a bug that would temporarily disable interrupts
- fixed two bugs related to stealing a weapon from an enemy, that would cause the hourglass cursor to appear 
  and not go away 
- fixed a bug in which the chance to hit someone was incorrectly calculated when aiming at a specific 
  body part.  A character that had partial cover behind the edge of a roof (e.g. only their head visible) 
  might have been impossible to hit due to a bullet-path check which was incorrectly 
  targeted at their chest.
