<!--
	We define various map interactions in this xml. If we hover our mouse (after right click) over a tile and it fits a set of data from here,
	we can interact with it, setting of various actions that.
	We can define interactions very broadly (example: we define all water taps found in any location in any map to behave a certain way) or 
	very precise (example: set a specific computer in a specific to do something). Note that more precise actions override broad descriptions
	(so we can set a very broad action for all water taps, and then define one specific one to behave differently).
		
	SectorGrid					sector that this action happens in
	sectorlevel					0: surface 1-3: basement
	
	If we do not set SectorGrid and sectorlevel, this action will work in any sector in any location (sStructureGridno and sLevel are no longer used). 
	
	szTileSetName				tileset that the structure we 'interact' with is part of
	usTileIndex					index of the structure in the tileset, multiple ones can be set
	
	These have to be set, and define what specific structures are valid for the action. We can set multiple indizes via usTileIndex (see examples).
	
	sStructureGridno			location of the structure (you can get that by pressing [f] in tactical), multiple ones can be set
	sLevel						0: floor level 1: on a roof -1: don't care
	
	If a specific map was set above, we can set a specific location here.
	
	sActionType					what kind of action is possible here?
								0: nothing
								1: hack a computer
								2: read a file from a file cabinet
								3: take water from a water tap
								4: buy soda from a soda machine
								5: play a minigame
	difficulty					how hard it is to perform action
	luaactionid					if this is set, lua script HandleInteractiveActionResult() in Overhead.lua is called 
								with this Id to perform special actions. If no ID is set, the standard action is called.
								
	In this file we always define in general with what we can interact, and then set specific interactions.
