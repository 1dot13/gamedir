<!-- 

	This list controls item transformations: the ability to turn an item into another item. This action is activated by clicking the item's
	picture in its Description Box, and selecting one of the possible transformations listed.
	
	TEMPLATE:
	
	<TRANSFORMATION_LIST> 					 Required at the very top of the list
		<TRANSFORM>							 Starts an entry
			<usItem></usItem>				 Index number of the original item (from items.xml)
			<usResult></usResult>			 Index number of resulting item (from items.xml)
			<usAPCost></usAPCost>			 AP Cost to perform action during turn-based combat. In 100AP values (so, 0-100).
			<iBPCost></iBPCost>				 BP Cost to perform action. In BP values (0-1000? Or 0-100? Not sure).
			<szMenuRowText></szMenuRowText>	 Name of the action, as it will appear on the Transformation menu.
			<szTooltipText></szTooltipText>  Full tooltip as it will appear when mousing-over the action name in the menu.
		</TRANSFORM>						 Closes the entry
	</TRANSFORMATION_LIST>					 Required at the very end of the list.
		
	NOTES:
	
	1) You may have more than 1 result per item. If more than one <usResult> tag is defined, more than two items will result after the
		transformation. The second(+) item will be automatically placed in the soldier's inventory, or dropped to the ground if no place
		is found for it.
		
	2) Any item may have more than 1 transformations available to it. In other words, two entries can have the same <usItem>. When this
		is done, the Transformation menu for this item will show both(+) options. Try not to have more than 10 options per item, or the menu 
		might overflow...
		
	3) After transformation, the item is automatically checked for attachment compatibility. Any previous attachments that are now incompatible
		are automatically removed from the item. If the item itself is an attachment, it will automatically be removed from its "parent".
		Existing permanent attachments are removed from an item upon transformation. If the new item has default attachments, they will be
		added to the new item as normal.
		
	4) AP Costs are charged only during battle. BP costs are probably charged anyway, I'm not sure. AP costs are automatically converted
		from 100 AP to 25AP (or any other AP system) depending on the player's choice - but you need to enter them in 100AP values here.
