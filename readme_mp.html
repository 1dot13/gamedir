            Don't think you can skip this step, there's too much in here
            which needs independently configuring per client to achieve successfull connection
            and gameplay.<br>
            <br>
            You will find a copy of this file with the release, this needs
            to go in your root Ja2 directory, along with the .exe included. It contains all
            the variables and parameters i have added which are convenient to change. They are
            read in from the file as part of starting up the Raknet Client. So if you change
            a setting in the file, you dont need to restart the game engine for effect, simply
            restart the net client. More&nbsp;about these variables in the following section
            where i detail each one.</div>

                This is now the first step after starting a new game and choosing
                initial game option, and is only done by the server, client changes have no effect.
                This cannot be changed once server started/running.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
                <br>
                Switch to the Airspace display by either clicking on the map button or pressing
                the 'A' key. Then click on the 'bullseye' to select it, (which will at startup be
                located at secotor 9,1 "Omerta"), then place it as the agreed/desired game sector.
                All hired Mercs and Bobby Rays orders will now be sent there.</div>

            Ok... start a new game and when presented with the map screen,
            press the '1' key, (it works on the numpad too). You should see some little remarks
            about the server starting up. If other clients cannot connect to you (the server),
            be sure that the selected port in ja2_mp.ini is forwarded on your router!</div>

            If you are the host you automatically connected to the server
            if you pressed '1'. If you aren't the host, start a new multiplayer game. The settings
            in the start new game screen does not matter, because you will receive the settings
            from the server after you connected. On strategy map screen, press the '2' key and
            you get connected to the server. In either situation you should see some comments about the Raknet
            network client starting up, and then if you have specified the right variables in
            Ja2_mp.ini and your network/firewall is "ok",&nbsp;you should make connection and
            see report of this from both the server and client. If you need to change a variable
            in your config or simply have another go at connecting, you can press the '2' key
            again after your attempt has been reported as failed, or kill the client/server
            and start it again.</div>

        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When all clients are connected and only then
        should you start hiring mercs, when the server is ready, they press the '3' key
        to unlock the laptop access.
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
            Boot up your laptop and hire up-to 7 Mercs from the selections
            at AIM and MERC... Due to the assumed fact that their proceeding action wont be
            longer than a day, the default chosen contract length, delivery time and confirmation
            have been adjusted for ease of use.<br>
            <br>
            I might also add here that this can be a good time to save the
            game, once all clients have hired their mercs, this way if there is a crash or some
            other problem or you just want to start again or play once more, you can do so quicker.
            Though bobby rays orders are not save at the moment, so save before placing them.</div>

        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
            I just had to add this in because i could ;p ... the default
            destination and shipping choice have been pre-set, and there's no difference in
            changing them.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            The delivery is now made immediately after order, and available
            from the map inventory screen, without loading the level !, into your pre-located
            crate as specified in the config file. Further orders can be made mid game. Note
            i've changed the defualt game options to gives the best bobby rays selection, this
            is great, unless you want it otherwise.</div>

            When all clients have followed the above steps and are ready
            for battle, from the map screen, press the '3' key. When all clients are ready,
            this will load the level and launch the&nbsp;"Tactical Placement GUI", as known
            by the overhead map view of the sector, allowing placement of Mercs along allocated
            edge space once all clients are loaded.</div>

            <a name="Placing_you_Mercs"></a>Placing your Mercs</h3>
        <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
            When all clients are loaded you can begin. *Be carefull
            if for some reason you will be placing opposed mercs along the same edge or at a
            corner where they may be in immediate sighting range of another clients enemy merc
            edge, you will probably have problems, as the code doesn't like starting the battle

            When all clients have finished with their merc placement and

            and when all are ready it will go into what is called "Tactical View". It will start
            in realtime until the the first opposed sighting is made at which time it changes
            to turn-based mode. The game can also switch back to realtime if each clients have
            not seen each other for some turns.</div>

            Let me break it to you now so as to dash those hopes you had
            of experiencing the full spectrum of intricacy and complexity afforded by the Ja2
            engine but in Multiplayer...<br>
            <br>
            Very little of the combat components have been implemented at this stage... here
            is the list of what is sent across the network and as such justifies allowed gameplay
            manouvers:<br>
            <br>
            ** moving your mercs on the ground level, ** changing stance between standing, crouching,
            and prone, ** changing facing direction, &nbsp;** firing a gun, ** bullet damages
            and ** stopping a merc apon spotting new enemy...<br>
            <br>
            I might also mention that ** knife damages,&nbsp;** punch damages,
            ** and burst fire damages are implemented, however the animations are not. This
            leaves pretty much all the rest of the fun un-implemented, so agree to avoid it
            to save confusion and invalid battle actions, for example, roofs, med packs,&nbsp;
            and grenades etc. etc.</div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">

            <div style="margin-left: 80px;">
                Once all but one team is left we have a winner, and you will
                either be presented with notification of defeat or, be returned to realtime and
                as such become the winner / survivor.<br>
                From here im not sure whatis possible, you could obviously start a new game, but
                you could also try hiring more mercs and gear, which will be delivered automatically.
                Perhaps even the survivor could walk to another sector, and those defeated, hiring
                more weapons and mercs could change their destination sector. Though it hasnt been
                tested...</div>

        <div style="margin-left: 80px;">
            Now's a good time to mention some new features, one is the Server Overide Function,
            bound to the key '7', which can be used by the server to bypass any of the mod's
            4 launch checkpoints. There is also a small help display bound to 'F1' and 'F2'
            if you forget your&nbsp; keys..., oh, there is also bound to '5' a script to show
            mouse grid coordinates.<br>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <div style="margin-left: 80px;">
            <br>
            The server can now also Manually end another players turn (or if in realtime, start
            turnbased action) with 'Alt+E'.<br>
            <br>
            As well the server can "kick" a player with 'Alt+K'. This removes all copies of
            that clients mercs throughout the network , causing there turn to be skipped, but
            leaving them connected to spectate.<br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it does... (you'll have to get back to me on that)<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I seems
            to have nutted out the problem stopping my initial sometimes working attempt from
            working all the time. it was that the Inv array part of the Merc Create struct ,
            which is a class and not that simple, was getting mangled through the RPC call,
            so i fixed it by pulling out the inventory items into a dedicated struct to hold
            them and the old struct, passing this, and then at the other end (the recieve) a
            new create merc struct is initiated, and filled with values from the old struct,
            (the bits that pass through ok), and the pulled out inventory items passed through
            "outside" with it.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems to work out, so let me know if you have any experience
            to comment on. The AI components are now set server side only. And are sent out
            when the server creates them, which is generally after going from the tactical placement
            gui, into the tactical "action" view.

            &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Currently we have RoWa21 from the boards coding some changes
            ! He's helped allready by mergin my oringinal code with thet latest 1.13 and NIV,
            he will also be helping with other coding areas. this being said theres plenty to
            be done and more help would be good. hopefully we can get coop working and the basic
            combat and movement systems working and synchronized effectively.<br />

                <a name="How_it_all_Works"></a>How it all Works</h3>
            (well some of it) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe you dont want to get your head under
            the bonet and into the code itself just yet but are just interested to know how
            i went about certain things, here's a brief run down.
            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well firslty i hope it does work, atleast some for you, ive barely
            play tested, just loading it up on my spare computer which is a laptop with no screen
            and a damaged faulty monitor output plug, enough though that i could test my code
            worked, but iver christmas i hope to test it further, perhaps you can to and give
            some feedback.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aside from the Initial Server and Client components which i transfered
            and modified from a "Chat Example" project that comes with RakNet. I used a function
            of RakNet called RPC or Remote Procedure Calls to send and recieve my communication.
            This is easy as it avoid having to package my data into packets, send it, then open
            it at the other end and work out what to do with it. An RPC function simply executes
            the function specified on the other specified remote clients, in this case all but
            the sender.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The server computer lets each client/side know when its there
            turn and the clients tell the server when they've finished they're's. When a client
            give the fire weapon order, an inital command is sent out to all the other clients
            telling them to do the same. Except when the other clients get to the bit of code
            which applies the hit and damage, if the command came from another Client they stop.
            Then when the Original client works out the hit damage taking into consideration
            random factors, and if it happened, and sends it out to all the other clients which
            then apply it hopefully in time to make it all seem connected.... You will notice
            wont short-coming of this, is that a client having recieved an order to replicate
            a weapon firing, may do so, but calculate that this particaular shot is going to
            miss, and such show the difference in arc for the bullet animation to miss, but
            just as you see the bullet whizzing past your head, you recieve the second command
            from the attacking client (the one which has the bullet hitting and it's damages)
            ... this is then applied and your on half health after breathing what was in this
            case, a too eager sigh of relief ... and the same example vice versa .<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As for the few other implemented commands, the are pretty simple
            and straight forward...<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So much of the time i've been looking through the code and i
            would find things that were almost perfectly set up for multiplayer and often not
            used at all, there was a definate effort by the original creators and they came
            close in my opinion... id love to know what stopped them... ?<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now another of the new systems implemented is the 4 new
            LAN teams (bteam: 6, 7, 8, and 9). How i did this was to have 4 new teams, 1 for
            wach client, max at 4. when client 1 hires a merc for example it is sent out and
            spawned on the other clients in team 6. client 2 in 7, client 3 in 8 and 4 in 9.
            The server (client 1) handles the team order and sends the command to each client
            to start any particualr teams turn, including the AI. There are a set number range
            of ubID's for each team: 6(client 1, the server) is 120 to 126 (7 members), on any
            client, their own mercs take slots 0 through 19 team 0, but when a client sends
            out a new move for example, the merc's ID (ubID) is prefixed (added) with a corresponding
            number to their client number (netbTeam) to match it with the network spawned merc
            copies in the other games. for example any clients first merc will be ubID 0 and
            team 0, if its client 1 (server) a prefix of 120 is added on to make its ubID 120
            which is the first clot for team 6 which is used to hold the "copies" of client
            1's team remotely. if its client 2, the prefix is 127, and so on... i hope this
            makes things clearer ;)<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The interupts are working again for what i have tested... and
            are only calculated by the merc (and owners computer) that is moving because they
            have the most up-to date info regarding merc (namely theirs) positions.<br>

                            &nbsp;ok , not alot of changes but some that will hopefully rectify a few of the
                            main issues popping up during testing so far... unfortuanately/fortunately this
                            is just a cheap hack/fix and a pretty raw solution, but ive ended going with it
                            for now as it is quick, it is accurate, and by the process of getting this far i
                            have learnt more that i can use later to upgrade or re-implement systems of synchronisation.
                            ie Dont get upset if it seems ive just patched some problems only to create some
                            more, (which may be the case as ive felt before), the aim is that this is atleast
                            a more evenly playable variant than before.<br>
                            <br>
                            * there is now a regular update sent out about every 2 seconds by the owner of each
                            merc with stats on location, health and breath, this should help with the related
                            issues.<br>
                            <br>
                            * when you assign a new destination for your merc, the calculated path is now sent
                            out as well as the destination grid, as to your mercs location. this way all merc
                            replications start their path from the same grid and follow the same path. (though
                            fences "work", they have not been refined)<br>
                            <br>
                            * There is a grid movement synchronisation system akin to what is known as "lock-step"
                            synchronisation, where no merc can advance further than the current grid with out
                            all the other replications of themselves being ready to do so as well. How i got
                            this to run smoothly and avoid the pause between the time of arrival, sending out
                            such, awaiting all others to do so, recieving the go-ahead and continuing, is by
                            requesting the sector in advance. So it is all happening in the background while
                            traversing a grid, and if all are in sync and ready, the next grid is moved onto
                            seemlesly ("nearly"), depending on ping... :)<br>
                            <br>
                            * stop commands are now synched further, such that when it is sent out it also contains
                            and thus applies the settings of position and direction so all replications are
                            stopped in the same grid.<br>
                            <br>
                            * The main Game engine no-longer automatically pauses game play while the Main Game
                            Window is not selected (or backgrounded/minimized). i havent got as far as blocking
                            game pausing altogether, but this will enable you to chat in irc etc. while the
                            game keeps running and updating graphics happily including network traffic. Due
                            to this the implementation of a chat system has been relegated in rank of things
                            to do as irc is an excellent system and the few times ive used it in my experience
                            ive been rather impressed. This too along with the fact that the implementation
                            of a chat system would hinder game play and game display more than using irc itself,
                            thus potentially bringing up further problems. You can quit easily fit a windowed
                            game of ja2 at 1024 along side a resized small window of irc with todays standard
                            1280 res, but if you ahve an extra monitor your set ;)<br>
                            <br>
                            * I also fixed a problem which im not sure when or if it had come up before, where
                            the servers mercs were being autoplaced apon ui unlock without selecting so.<br>
                            <br>
                            * Also im now back to distibuting debug exe builds, as after packing it isnt much
                            size difference, and by running a debug exe you get a few more stats on errors and
                            such, and it is further tested, by the community which i owe a big thankyou to for
                            the feedback so far both through the forum thread and the ja2 1.13 jagzilla bugzilla
                            bug tracking site.<br>
                            <br>
                            * I also disabled a mercs reproduction checking for enough AP's before making moves
                            etc, as this is calculated by the owners game instance and results applied from
                            there.<br>
                            <br>
                            All these updates should work just and well (and have been slightly tested so) to
                            work with both real-time and turnbased.<br>
                            <br>
                            Happily all this synchronisation hasnt increased network traffic much at all and
                            it still quite happily trots along at under 1kb/s in idle tactical view.<br>
                            <br>
                            Please report any problems you have as i rely on this mostly, due to any spare time
                            i have being spent on resting and doing other things than coding, leaving little
                            time for testing than that is necessary to check my changes "work" atleast...<br>

                            * disabled hourly updates - causing breath loss on insertion on clients pc, but
                            not happening on remote merc duplicates, leading to unsync due to differing ani
                            speeds. this will have been accounting alot for some of why one merc has been faining
                            while the other still standing... this is big fix, you stil will get "slight unsyncs"
                            (a few grids), so someday i will still implement actualy updating of merc params
                            and traversal. (as there is atleast a small delay between when your werc starts
                            running and your merc replication starts running, throwing things like interrupts
                            and first time spots out of allignment between pc')<br>

                            * fixed another possible unsyncer of a problem, where a client replicating a mercs
                            move would pause the merc when it spotted another enemy merc (possibly there's)
                            even though the merc being moved wasnt in their control and was a replication...
                            so now only stops if ordered from moving owner...<br>
                            &nbsp;<br>
                            * added manual start for turn based mode, if the server want to start off a team
                            straight up without realtime, might be handy for testing...<br>
                            <br>

                            <br>
                            * fixed a bug brought on by the&nbsp; screen locking function i started using, (to
                            enable moving screen while not turn). prob was it wasnt unlocking prop for interrupts,
                            so that is fixed now.<br>
                            <br>
                            * fixed a bug where interupt timed turn was going too quick as to the turn after
